= FFM Autolinker: A utility for easy integration with the Java FFM API

image:https://img.shields.io/maven-central/v/io.github.dmlloyd.autolinker/ffm-autolinker?color=green[]

== Overview

The `ffm-autolinker` project provides an easy means to call foreign (a.k.a. native) functions using regular Java APIs.

The Java FFM API exposes function downcalls as `MethodHandle` instances,
which are generally difficult to work with.
Tools like `jextract` will automate this to a degree,
however it is difficult to produce a cross-platform library using this tool.

=== Important note

This is a library intended *only for advanced users* who are intimately familiar with C, native code, and the intricacies of ABIs and calling conventions.
Because this library provides a way to access native code,
just like the Java FFM API,
it is very possible for poor usage of this library to cause major problems and malfunctions that can result in data loss or worse.

*Do not use this library unless you understand and accept the risks inherent in native coding*.

=== Requirements

This project uses the Java FFM API, which is final since Java 22.
Therefore, Java 22 or later is required to use `ffm-autolinker`.
The classes of this project target Java 17 for ease of integration.

=== Quick example

To give an example of what `ffm-autolinker` does to help with this problem,
consider a simple program that wants to call the `abs` function from `libc`.
Using `ffm-autolinker`, one can do this:

.A quick example of `ffm-autolinker` in action.
[source,java]
----
import io.github.dmlloyd.autolinker.Link;

public interface LibC {
    @Link
    int abs(int val);
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        LibC libc = new AutoLinker(MethodHandles.lookup()).autolink(LibC.class);
        // now I can call any native method defined on my LibC interface!
        int res = libc.abs(-12345);
        System.out.printf("The result was: %d%n", res);
    }
}
----

== Usage

The primary interface of `ffm-autolinker` is the `AutoLinker` class.
An instance of this class must be created,
given an instance of `MethodHandles.Lookup` which has sufficient permissions
to define a class in the same package as the interface(s) which contain the link stubs.

[source,java]
----
AutoLinker autoLinker = new AutoLinker(MethodHandles.lookup());
----

This instance can then be used to create linked instances of interface(s) containing link stub methods.

=== Link stubs

A "link stub" method is a method on an interface which is `public`, non-`static`, and is `abstract`
(i.e. not a `default` method), and is annotated with the `@Link` annotation.

=== Type equivalency

Java primitive types and native (i.e. C) primitive types are not equivalent,
despite sometimes sharing the same name.
While Java strictly defines the size and signed-ness of its primitive types,
the C language specification allows latitude based on the target CPU type and compiler implementation.
Inconveniently, many libraries rely on C types, which makes portable programming more difficult.

In order to mitigate this problem, `ffm-autolinker` provides two mechanisms.

==== Implicit type conversion

The following implicit type conversions are defined:

.Implicit type conversions
[id="implicit"]
[cols="1,2"]
|===
| Java type | Native type

| `boolean` | `_Bool`
| `byte` | `signed char` / `int8_t`
| `char` | `char16_t` / `uint16_t`
| `short` | `int16_t`
| `int` | `int`
| `long` | `int64_t` / `long long`
| `float` | `float`
| `double`  | `double`
| `MemorySegment` | (any pointer type)
| `byte[]` +
`char[]` +
`short[]` +
`int[]` +
`long[]` +
`float[]` +
`double[]`
| (any pointer type)
| `String` | `const char *` (in UTF-8 encoding)
| Instance of `NativeEnum` | `int`
| `void` | `void`
|===

==== Explicit type conversion

When calling a function which accepts or returns a type for which there is no implicit conversion,
the annotation `@Link.as` should be applied to the parameter or return type.

The argument to the `@Link.as` annotation is a value of type `AsType`, which is an enumeration.

.Explicit type conversions
[id="explicit"]
[cols="1,1,2"]
|===
| `AsType` value | Native type | Notes

| `signed_char` | `signed char` |
| `unsigned_char` | `unsigned char` |
| `char_` | `char` | The signedness of `char` is not specified.
| `int_` | `int` |
| `unsigned_int` | `unsigned int` |
| `long_` | `long` |
| `unsigned_long` | `unsigned long` |
| `long_long` | `long long` |
| `unsigned_long_long` | `unsigned long long` |

| `int8_t` | `int8_t` |
| `uint8_t` | `uint8_t` |
| `int16_t` | `int16_t` |
| `uint16_t` | `uint16_t` |
| `int32_t` | `int32_t` |
| `uint32_t` | `uint32_t` |
| `int64_t` | `int64_t` |
| `uint64_t` | `uint64_t` |

| `char7_t` | `char` | Only values in the range 0-127 are passed.

| `char8_t` | `char8_t` (C23 or later) | This is equivalent to `unsigned char`.
| `char16_t` | `char16_t` (C11 or later) |
| `char32_t` | `char32_t` (C11 or later) |

| `ptrdiff_t` | `ptrdiff_t` |
| `intptr_t` | `intptr_t` |
| `uintptr_t` | `uintptr_t` |
| `size_t` | `size_t` |
| `ssize_t` | `ssize_t` |

| `ptr` | `void *` (or any pointer type) |
| `void_` | none (argument or return value is dropped) |
|===

[source,java]
----
import io.github.dmlloyd.autolinker.Link;

import static io.github.dmlloyd.autolinker.Link.as;
import static io.github.dmlloyd.autolinker.AsType.long_;

//...

@Link
@as(long_) long labs(@as(long_) long n);
----

==== Signed/unsigned value handling

When converting an argument or return value to a wider type,
the signedness of the native type is what determines whether the value is sign-extended
or zero-extended.

For example, given a method parameter declaration like this:
`@as(size_t) int foobar`,
when the target platform uses 64 bits for `size_t`, the argument will be zero-extended
as if it were passed through the method `Integer.toUnsignedLong(foobar)`.

When converting an argument or return value to a narrower type, the value is truncated.
This may result in a negative value when the Java type is signed,
even if the corresponding native type is unsigned.

==== Native enumerations

Some types are defined in terms of constants (for example, values for `errno`).
These constants may be the same on all platforms, or may vary.
To help simplify mapping between named constants and their corresponding integral values,
an interface called `NativeEnum` is provided.

Any object whose class implements this interface can be specified as an argument
in any place where an integral type can be given,
as if the value type of the argument was Java `int` (see above for implicit conversions).
Other integral types are supported using `@Link.as` as described above.
This is particularly suitable for Java `enum` types.

If a function is declared to return a value of a type which implements `NativeEnum`,
then that type will be expected to provide a static method called `fromNativeCode(int)`
which accepts an `int` and returns
an instance of the type given for the function return value.

It is the responsibility of the implementer to provide the correct mapping
for the platform specific value of each enumeration constant.

=== In/out parameters

A parameter which operates on a pointer to heap data may be declared to have a direction.
The direction declared on a parameter determines whether data needs to be copied to or from the given argument.

|===
| Name | Meaning
| `in` | The parameter data is read by the function
| `out` | The parameter data is written by the function
| `in_out` | The parameter data is both read and written by the function
|===

Temporary buffers are allocated as needed to pass information between the user object and the native function.

Note that <<crit_heap,critical functions which are declared to access the heap>> will automatically skip copying when passing an array argument.
Likewise, non-pointer argument types are generally not copied regardless
of the declared direction.

Note that arguments of type `String` are _always_ copied as if the direction is `in`,
and should be avoided in performance-sensitive code.

If no copy would be needed for an argument, then the direction is ignored, and the parameter value would be treated as if it had declared a direction of `in_out` (that is, the contents referred to by the pointer could be modified).

[id=crit]
=== Critical functions

The Java FFM API provides a means to indicate that a foreign function is "critical",
meaning that it "has an extremely short running time in all cases (similar to calling an empty function), and does not call back into Java (e.g. using an upcall stub)".

To indicate that a function is critical, use the `@Link.critical` annotation.

.An example of calling a critical function.
[source,java]
----
import io.github.dmlloyd.autolinker.Link;

import static io.github.dmlloyd.autolinker.Link.critical;
import static io.github.dmlloyd.autolinker.AsType.int_;

//...

@Link
@critical
double sin(double n);
----

[id=crit_heap]
==== Heap access

Critical functions can additionally be flagged as being able to access the heap.
This is useful for functions which manipulate heap arrays,
as such functions do not have to copy the array contents before or after operating on them.

.An example of calling a function which touches the heap.
[source,java]
----
import io.github.dmlloyd.autolinker.Link;

import static io.github.dmlloyd.autolinker.Link.as;
import static io.github.dmlloyd.autolinker.Link.critical;
import static io.github.dmlloyd.autolinker.AsType.int_;
import static io.github.dmlloyd.autolinker.AsType.ptr;
import static io.github.dmlloyd.autolinker.AsType.size_t;

//...

@Link
// we want to access the heap.
@critical(heap = true)
// memset normally returns `void *` but we want to ignore the return value.
@as(ptr) void memset(byte[] buf, @as(int_) char c, @as(size_t) int count);
----

=== Call state capturing functions

Functions may return a value into an auxiliary location, such as `errno`.
When using the Java FFM API, this is done by storing the call result into
a buffer which is passed in to the function handle.

This can be similarly achieved with `ffm-autolinker` by using the `@Link.capture` annotation.

.An example of a function call which captures `errno`.
[source,java]
----
import io.github.dmlloyd.autolinker.Link;

import static io.github.dmlloyd.autolinker.Link.as;
import static io.github.dmlloyd.autolinker.Link.capture;
import static io.github.dmlloyd.autolinker.AsType.size_t;
import static io.github.dmlloyd.autolinker.AsType.ssize_t;

public interface Io {
    //...

    @Link
    @as(ssize_t) int read(@capture("errno") MemorySegment state, int fd, MemorySegment buf, @as(size_t) int count);

    //...
}
----

When the call returns, the captured call state is stored in the memory segment identified by `state`.
It can be accessed like this:

.An example of accessing a captured call state value.
[source,java]
----

static final VarHandle handle = Linker.Option.captureStateLayout()
        .varHandle(MemoryLayout.PathElement.groupElement("errno"));

public static void main(String[] args) {
    AutoLinker autoLinker = new AutoLinker(MethodHandles.lookup());
    Io io = autoLinker.autolink(Io.class);
    // ...
    int res = io.read(state, fd, buf, cnt);
    // now get the error code out of `state`
    int errno = (int) handle.get(state);
    // ...
}

----


=== Alternative link names

Sometimes it is desirable for the method name to differ from the function name.
In these cases, a `name` argument may be given to `@Link`,
giving the alternative name.

.An example of alternative link name usage.
[source,java]
----
// ...

@Link
int rand();

@Link(name = "rand")
@as(int_) short rand_as_short();
----

In the above example, the method `rand_as_short()` calls the native function `rand()`
and truncates the result to a 16-bit signed integer (`short`).

=== Variadic functions

When a function is variadic, it is necessary to tell the linker which argument
is the first variadic argument.
This may be done with the `@Link.va_start` annotation.

.An example of calling variadic functions with overloads.
[source,java]
----
import static io.github.dmlloyd.autolinker.Link.as;
import static io.github.dmlloyd.autolinker.Link.critical;
import static io.github.dmlloyd.autolinker.Link.va_start;
import static io.github.dmlloyd.autolinker.AsType.int_;

//...

@Link
@critical(heap = true)
void printf(byte[] buf, @va_start @as(int_) int value);

@Link
@critical(heap = true)
void printf(byte[] buf, @va_start float value);
----

=== Cross-platform usage

In some cases, the name and signature for a given function ends up being
the same across all platforms where Java runs.
However, in some cases the names or types end up differing in an incompatible manner.

One strategy to mitigate this problem is to define an alternative sub-interface for divergent platforms.
For example, consider this interface:

.An interface whose implementation would differ by platform
[source,java]
----
public interface Errno {
    @Link
    @critical(heap = true)
    @as(ptr) void strerror_r(int errnum, byte[] buf, @as(size_t) int bufLen);
}
----

As it happens, `glibc` has a non-standard `strerror_r` method.
The standard one is hidden under an alternative name, `__xpg_strerror_r`.

One way to mitigate this problem is to define a sub-interface which can be chosen
based on the platform.

.An interface whose implementation would differ by platform
[source,java]
----
public interface LinuxErrno extends Errno {
    @Link(name = "__xpg_strerror_r")
    @critical(heap = true)
    @as(ptr) void strerror_r(int errnum, byte[] buf, @as(size_t) int bufLen);
}
----

Then you would select the interface to auto-link based on the detected platform.

.An example of selecting the interface to use by platform
[source,java]
----
import io.smallrye.common.os.OS;
// ... other imports elided ...

public static void main(String[] args) {
    // ...
    AutoLinker autoLinker = new AutoLinker(lookup());
    Errno errno = autoLinker.autolink(switch (OS.current()) {
        case LINUX -> LinuxErrno.class;
        default -> Errno.class;
    });
    // ...
}
----

=== Security considerations

The Java FFM API is a "restricted" API, which means that explicit permission must be granted on the command line to use it.
The auto-linking implementation classes are defined in the same package as the interface
which contains the link stubs.
Therefore, the module of this package must be granted permission to access native methods.
This can normally be achieved using the `--enable-native-access` switch.

The switch accepts as an argument the name of the module which requires native access,
or the special string `ALL-UNNAMED` to allow all classpath classes to access native methods.

If you are security-conscious and choose to restrict native access only to those modules which need it,
it is important to be aware of who can access the autolinked instances,
as well as the autolinker itself.
Both of these things will have privileged access to your module and the system as a whole
so these instances should generally be kept in private or package-private fields.
